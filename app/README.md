# IfcOpenShell WASM Playground

Check out the demos: [sayanjdas.pythonanywhere.com](https://sayanjdas.pythonanywhere.com/)

A minimalistic webpage that explores IfcOpenShell and IfcTester WASM functionality, as per discussed ideas in the OSArch community chat.
The demos correspond to the ideas highlighted in my GSoC 2025 proposal:
- Autocompletions
- Auditing IFC models with IDS and report generation
- IDS authoring layer
